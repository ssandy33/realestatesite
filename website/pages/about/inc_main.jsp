I'm a Chicago native that relocated to Arizona in 2004 and though my heart will always be in Chicago I have grown to 
love and embrace all the beauty in Arizona.  Arizona has so much to offer to all lifestyles. 
Arizona is a place that does not allow any room for boredom.  There will always be something to do, explore, visit, see and experience.  
And we are also neighbors to fabulous destinations whether you decide on a short weekend trip or a month long stay.

If you are from out of state and need to list your property I can help you with that too.  I have a great network of agents where I can be a resource 
for you in this area too.  Lets schedule an appointment today to get your home sold or to begin your search for your new home or second home.
