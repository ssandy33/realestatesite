				<p>Is it time for more space? Or a move due to a new job? No matter the reason, for a seller it can be an enjoyable time planning for your next home, but emotional as you remember all your current home has provided. Fortunately, I have the resources to help sellers with every step of the process.</p>
				
				<h5 class="page-title bold" style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:6px; text-transform:uppercase;">Start the Process</h5>
				<p>When you start the process, you should consider your timeline and goals. Why are you selling? What do you hope to gain? What are your fears? Take some time to think about these and put your goals and timeline to paper.</p>
				<p>Feeling overwhelmed already? Don't be! Let me help you start the process. I will sit down with you and your family to walk you through these seller questions to help identify your goals. This will be the baseline for everything moving forward.</p>
				
				<h5 class="page-title bold" style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:6px; text-transform:uppercase;">Next Steps</h5>
				<p>The next steps include understanding how you will properly price your property, reviewing market conditions and getting your home prepared to show.</p>
				<p>In order to determine an appropriate price for your home, I will complete a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) to understand the property's condition, compare it to the market and set an accurate price. Setting the right price before you list is critical to getting the most for your home and selling it quickly. Having a professional with experience in your neighborhood prepare a CMA gives you the facts and insight to set the right price.</p>
				<p>From there, the next steps are to review your property with buyer's eyes. Take a fresh look at your home, scrutinizing each aspect from curb appeal to sizing up the interior as though you are seeing it for the first time. Make a mental note of the things that might put off potential buyers, along with another list of the things that first attracted you to your home. Then start organizing. Clean out the clutter and put away all personal items. Your potential buyers need help imagining what it would be like to live in your house. You may think about staging your home, or hiring a professional home stager.</p>
				<p>The next steps are to clean, clean and clean again. It can never be too neat or orderly. If you show that you care for the home, chances are you may be able to get more for the property because your potential buyers will see it too. Also, make any and all repairs necessary to put your best foot forward.</p>
				
				<h5 class="page-title bold" style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:6px; text-transform:uppercase;">Marketing</h5>
				<p>Now it's time for marketing! Sellers can expect photos to be taken of the property as soon as it's cleared of clutter and personal items, staged and cleaned. Photos are the most reviewed item on a real estate website and can greatly impact the marketing and ultimately the sale of your home. I will have professional photographs taken, or even shoot videos to help showcase special features of your home or the neighborhood.</p>
				<p>At this time, a sign will be placed in your yard and the listing for your home will be placed on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). I wil do additional marketing, for example, on websites, through mailings or email campaigns. They will also share the property with other sales associates within our company to help find appropriate and approved buyers.</p>
			
				<h5 class="page-title bold" style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:6px; text-transform:uppercase;">Offer</h5>
				<p>Before you receive an offer, you will have calls for a showing. This requires you to leave the home for a period of time, while a buyer's agent takes their clients through your home, or in other words, on the showing. Some buyers will see the home several times before making an offer. Once an offer is made, I will take you step-by-step through the offer and what each section means. I will go to work negotiating the offer with the buyer's agent and potential buyer. A professional Realtor is key to negotiating the terms and conditions specified in the purchase contract. As the seller, you may choose to accept terms, reject the offer or present a counter offer.</p>
				
				<h5 class="page-title bold" style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:6px; text-transform:uppercase;">Closing</h5>
				<p>The final step is closing the deal. A closing takes place at an attorney's office or a title company of your choice. When all the applicable paperwork has been signed, notarized and recorded at the County Recorder's Office, the keys are handed over to the buyer.</p>
